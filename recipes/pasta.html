    <H2>Description</H2>
    <p>This Olive Garden Alfredo sauce is better than the famous Italian restaurant chain's version. Alfredo sauce has always had my heart, whether chicken Alfredo or fettuccine Alfredo. This is a simple and basic recipe for Italian starters. Sprinkle some freshly chopped parsley over your plate for an added touch. Enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons sweet butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter and olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add cream, garlic, and white pepper; bring to just under a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, until mixture is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir Parmesan cheese into cream mixture; simmer until sauce is thickened and smooth, 8 to 10 minutes. Add mozzarella cheese; cook and stir until melted, about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Stir pistachios, bread crumbs, butter, olive oil, and a pinch of salt and black pepper in a bowl. Spread mustard on the fat-side of each rack of lamb. Pat pistachio mixture on top of mustard. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden and lamb is pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let rest 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
